Description: A Snake Game
The project is a snake video game like the first games of the old Nokia mobile phones. The goal is to be alive with the snake as long it is possible. To grow up and get faster you have to eat the food which appears as a F randomly.

Controls:
To control the snake use the keys w(up),a(left),s(down),d(right) but no capital letters of this. 


Let's beginn:
How to install:
Open the file snake_game.rb with a ruby interpreter.

How to run:
Now you will see the start screen with a map. It will start automaticly. To control the snake use the keys from control. If you started the snake will go to the right of the map. Locate the food and try to eat it. When you got it the snake will grow up one stone and get a little bit faster. Repeat this as long you can. If you hit the wall or yourself, the game will be over.
